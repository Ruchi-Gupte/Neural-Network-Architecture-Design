# Architectures Implemented
- YOLO
- SOLO
- RPN Backbone
- FasterRCNN
- VAE, GANs, Cyclic GANs

All have been implemented using Pytorch and from scratch. For Faster RCNN I have used inbuilt backbone but a more simplified version of the backbone(RPN) has been implemented from scratch separately.

# Code
Code cannot be shared due to it being a part of CIS 680 Advanced Perception by the University of Pennsylvania as under my coursework but would be happy to share code privately as needed. Results have been made public instead.
