# Architectures Implemented
- YOLO
- SOLO
- RPN Backbone
- FasterRCNN
- VAE, GANs, Cyclic GANs

All have been implemented using Pytorch and from scratch. For Faster RCNN I have used inbuilt backbone but a more simplified version of the backbone(RPN) has been implemented from scratch separately.

# Code
Code cannot be shared due to it integrity guidelines for CIS 680 Advanced Perception: the University of Pennsylvania as it was conducted under my coursework. But would be happy to share code privately as needed. Results have been made public instead.
